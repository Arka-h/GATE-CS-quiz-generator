# GATE-CS-quiz-generator
Multi-section quiz generator based on [GO's 3 volumes of PYQs](https://gatecse.in/gate-overflow-book-qa-only-previous-gate-tifr/) <br>
1. Takes in volume no., section no.(s) & no. of questions.
2. Randomly generates paper📄, simulates GATE q distribution [Uses distribution of questions per section/sub-section]. 
3. Reduces cognitive load on reaching the goal 🚩 of finishing all PYQs, gamifies 🎮 your attempts.
4. Since it is a CLI quiz generator, currently it displays the question to attempt, and tracks attempt time⌛.
5. Keeps track of the questions attempted ✅, and never repeats a previously attempted question.
5. Implements binary search on pdf to find and display question's page no. [saves seen pages' question nos for faster🕔 access]
6. Generates reports in log files 📝, having the questions attempted and attempt times, along with other statistics 📈
7. Code is flexible and can be changed to suit one's needs. For ex. different pdfs, different exam; just need to change some csv files having meta information 

>    NOTE : The pdf search can also be used to find the question. *Beware*, as it may lead you straight to the "answer key" page/ "pyq answer"

## Usage
<br>

The only dependency is the pypdf2 package

> ```$ pip install PyPDF2```
